### Populist mobilization in the Andes

In my dissertation, I aim to explain the sources of variation in the dynamics of populist mobilization. When and why do local populist mobilizations reach national level politics? Do they always need to use electoral vehicles or can they remain on the sidelines? What are the effects of populist mobilizations on democratic stability? I use the cases of Peru and Bolivia to analyse dynamics of populist mobilization in Latin America over the last twenty years.

My analysis is focused on the supporters, not the leader of the populist mobilizations. Contrary to traditional scholarship that has studied populism as a campaign strategy rooted in the use of populist rhetoric by a charismatic leader, my approach is focused on populism from the bottom-up. Populism, I argue, can emerge organically from the constant and collaborative interaction of individuals who self-identify as "the marginalized". It is through the convergence of resentment that mobilization is born, and the umbrella that populist rhetoric provides is big enough to encompass the diverse range of issues that join these individuals. 

The main challenge for populist mobilizations is to trespass the geographical confines of local grievances. Usually one or two core issues drive local populist mobilizations and the populist rhetoric allows for articulation among members of the same local space (district or region). However, populist rhetoric is not enough to mobilize neighboring communities and produce national level mobilization. Instead, structural factors at play can limit mobilizations and maintain them fragmented, or they can promote the emergence of a national populist mobilization.

My dissertation aims to explain the emergence of populist mobilization at the local from a bottom-up perspective, and to identify the factors that motivate or limit the capacity of populist mobilizations to reach national-level politics.
